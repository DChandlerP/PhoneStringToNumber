# PhoneStringToNumber
People often write their phone numbers in cryptic ways like Area Code "4 one 7" on craigslist ads. I wrote a simple script
that takes those numbers and makes them into a string I can use with google voice. Right now it works for the examples I personally
see the most often, but I'll update is I experience new test cases in the real world.
